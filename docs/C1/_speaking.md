# CAE Speaking

[C1 Advanced Speaking test - Raphael and Maude | Cambridge English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nGESyDgmdw)

## Part 1

- **Do you work** or are you a student?
  - I work as a computer engineer, and even though I am 41 years old, I have recently decided to study the Advanced Certificate in English.
- what **skills** do you need for the job you do or plan to do?
  - My goal is to become fluent in English to enhance my communication skills and stay up to date with the latest advancements in my field.
- What would make a job appeal to you?
  - A job that appeals to me would be one that allows me to grow both professionally and personally. In addition, a good work-life balance and the possibility of continuous learning would make a job even more attractive
- How do you help yourself concentrate on your work?
  - To help myself concentrate on my work, I often set specific goals for each task, breaking them down into smaller steps. "Divide and conquer". Also, I use techniques like the Pomodoro method, which involves working in focused intervals followed by brief rests, to maintain productivity throughout the day
- have your **ambitions** changed over the last five years?
  - Absolutely, my ambitions have changed over the last five years, mainly because I now have two young daughters. I am now focused on finding a healthy balance between work and family life.

  ## Part 2

- In the first image, we can see a well-dressed executive, wearing a jacket and tie, running down the street, while in the second image, there are two police officers dressed in full police uniforms, complete with helmets, guns, and other professional equipment. The most obvious and unique similarity between them is that they are both running.  
In my opinion, the first person is probably running because he is late for a meeting, while in the second image, the individuals are probably running due to an emergency.  
I believe both of their lives can be very stressful. Executives often work long hours every day, and police officers face danger daily in the line of duty

### 1. what do the weels enable people to do? 2. how important may they be?

The two images show a potter’s wheel and a water wheel, both of which have played crucial roles in human history, though in very different ways.

The potter’s wheel is used by artisans to shape clay into objects like bowls, plates, or vases. It makes this process faster and more precise, helping people create both useful and artistic items. On the other hand, the water wheel uses the power of moving water to do work. Historically, it has been used to grind grain, pump water, or power machines, contributing significantly to agriculture and early industry.

These wheels are extremely important. The potter’s wheel supports cultural and functional needs, helping communities create tools and art. The water wheel, in turn, was an early way to produce energy, helping communities grow and industries develop. These wheels show how simple tools can have a big impact on people’s lives.

### 1 communication by a handwritten letter or using a walkie-talkie.

The two images show two very different ways of communication: a handwritten letter and a man in a snowy mountain using a walkie-talkie.

The person writing a letter might have chosen this way to communicate because it’s personal and thoughtful. Handwritten letters are often used to express emotions or share important news in a meaningful way. On the other hand, the man on the mountain is using a walkie-talkie because it’s practical for his situation. In remote or snowy areas, where there’s no mobile phone signal, a walkie-talkie is a reliable tool to stay in contact.

However, both methods have challenges. Writing a letter takes time, and the person has to wait for it to be delivered, which makes communication slow. For the man using the walkie-talkie, the difficulty could be the signal quality or background noise, especially in a harsh environment like a snowy mountain. Despite these challenges, both ways can be very effective when used for the right purpose.
