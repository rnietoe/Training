# CAE Speaking

## Part 1

- **Do you work** or are you a student?
  - I work as a computer engineer, and even though I am 41 years old, I have recently decided to study the Advanced Certificate in English.
- what **skills** do you need for the job you do or plan to do?
  - My goal is to become fluent in English to enhance my communication skills and stay up to date with the latest advancements in my field.
- What would make a job appeal to you?
  - A job that appeals to me would be one that allows me to grow both professionally and personally. In addition, a good work-life balance and the possibility of continuous learning would make a job even more attractive
- How do you help yourself concentrate on your work?
  - To help myself concentrate on my work, I often set specific goals for each task, breaking them down into smaller steps. "Divide and conquer". Also, I use techniques like the Pomodoro method, which involves working in focused intervals followed by brief rests, to maintain productivity throughout the day
- have your **ambitions** changed over the last five years?
  - Absolutely, my ambitions have changed over the last five years, mainly because I now have two young daughters. I am now focused on finding a healthy balance between work and family life.

  ## Part 2

- In the first image, we can see a well-dressed executive, wearing a jacket and tie, running down the street, while in the second image, there are two police officers dressed in full police uniforms, complete with helmets, guns, and other professional equipment. The most obvious and unique similarity between them is that they are both running.  
In my opinion, the first person is probably running because he is late for a meeting, while in the second image, the individuals are probably running due to an emergency.  
I believe both of their lives can be very stressful. Executives often work long hours every day, and police officers face danger daily in the line of duty
