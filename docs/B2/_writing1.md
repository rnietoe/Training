# Some people say you don’t need much money to be happy. What do you think?

1. when money is necessary 
2. having the latest gadgets
3. being happy without spending money

In my book, having a lot of money is not required to be happy in the modern world for the following reasons.

First and foremost, although money is essential for life’s day to day necessities, it is possible to be careful and not spend too much. On the other hand, if a mother lived like this, not having enough to buy a present for their child or pay for a much-needed pair of glasses, it could lead to chronic unhappiness.

On the other hand, it may seem quite easy for that mother or for older people in general to live without the latest devices such as mobile phones or computers, but for teenagers and children it would be almost impossible. Not being able to use these items as their peers do, would be terrible for them.

Last but not least, many believe that they can survive without any luxuries because the simple things in life can make them content. A walk along the beach, a beautiful sunset or just being in love with their girlfriend or boyfriend can bring them unbridled happiness.

In conclusion, although having some money is essential, I believe it does not mean that the more someone has the happier they will be. Simple things and being surrounded by nature often bring more contentment.

# What are the most important things we need to do to make and keep friends?

1. keep in touch regularly
2. always tell a friend the truth
3. well-being

In my book, the pillars for making and maintaining friendships are as follows.

First and foremost, meeting buddies again or on a regular basis is a firmer foundation for long-lasting relationships. On the other hand, a person who only gets in touch when they need something and who disappears when the roles are reversed is not a true friend at all. 

Secondly, it is needless to say that honest and transparent communications are essential for any companionship. In addition, this dialogue should also be reliable. Friends should be able to tell each other the truth even if it is harsh or difficult to hear. If friends will not tell you, there are not many others who will, apart from your mother.

Last but not least, friendship plays a crucial role in our well-being, as it provides emotional support and a deep sense of belonging. This encourages personal growth and contributes significantly to our overall happiness.

In conclusion and having considered all of the above, there are several reasons why making friends and continuing the relationship are so important. They provide partnership, support, and countless opportunities for great personal development.

# Do we share too much personal information on social media websites?

1. uploading images
2. posting comments
3. fake information

In my book, social media users share too much information about their personal lives. I believe these are the three main reasons.

First and foremost, sharing photographs can reveal personal details to thieves. When people are on vacation sharing their images in the network, others can find out about their relationships with other individuals. Additionally, they can inform criminals their house is currently empty.

Secondly, commenting on other users’ posts or blogs can also present privacy concerns. Doing this can draw the commenter into discussions, which can end in unintentionally revealing private details. These details, such as date of birth, can be used by these scammers to try and hack into bank accounts and other financial sites.

Last but not least, regardless of how someone meets another user online, they will probably never know who that person is. It is impossible to check whether that man or woman is telling the truth or not. For example, if someone makes friends online, it is easy for them to give fake information.

In conclusion and having considered all of the above, although social networks are a lot of fun, it is advisable to take precautions and understand that people may not be who they say they are

# Some people say that young people can only entertain themselves in front of a screen. What do you think?

1. why screen entertainment is so popular
2. books and reading
3. health aware

In my book, screens are not the only way that youngsters can entertain themselves for the following reasons.

First of all, screens are an integral part of the current technological revolution, it is easy for adolescents to be able to use them well. There are several way to be entertained using sreens, from video games to smartphones and computers, but that is not a reason to ignore other, more traditional ways.

Secondly, reading offers readers a different experience. For many, it gives them more peace than any electronic device. Admitedly, there are e electronics readers, but for a significant number of individuals feeling a real book, being able to make notes and being able to display a collection in a shelf is more important.

Last but not least, young people are extremely aware of what is healthy or unhealthy. Paying attention to diet and exercise is considered essential to modern day life, which is why sports and other energetic passtimes are popular among this age group.

In conclusion, and having considered all of the above, screen entertainment is accepted as a part of life today, but young persons are quite able to entertain themselves in a variety of different ways too.

# Some people say you can learn almost everything from the internet nowadays. What do you think?

1. the role of parents and teachers
2. the quality of the information available
3. complement and deeper understanding

In my book, there are several reasons why the internet is not able to teach users about every subject.

First of all, there is a vast amount of information on the internet but compared to the step-by-step approaches taken by both teachers and parents, it is too disorganised. As a result, this leads users to learn some aspects of a subject while leaving other, often more vital ones, undiscovered.

Furthermore, this disorganised information is also published online by many unknown publishers. While the vast majority of them have every intention of being accurate and reliable, there is a section who post fake information for their own ends. For example, an extreme political party can post fake news about their rivals.

Last but not least, many have learned to use the virtual information to complement what they already know. They may read a newspaper, for instance, find an interesting article and then visit the internet for a deeper understanding.

In conclusion, I personally believe people should learn new topics in traditional ways, while consulting the internet to learn more about the subjects they are interested in.

# Popular tourist destination

1. local economy
2. quality of life
3. transport connections

In my book, living in a tourist destination is better because of the following advantages

First of all, it is undeniable that residing in such tourist areas increases the local economy. Foreigners are used to spending their money generously, which, in turn, creates job opportunities for locals.

Therefore it is reasonable to  expect an enhanced quality of life in tourist cities when you have money and a wide range of services to enjoy. You can enjoy cultural activies like going to the theater or the cinema

It is a fact of common knowledge that these destinations are well connected by transport, so living here allows you to travel abroad easily since you do not need to spend time moving to a near city just to catch a plane or a train - maybe a ship as well.

To sum up, there are many adventages on living in a place where tourist like to travel. I also want to add that i am lucky to live in Jerez de la Frontera, world famous for its wines, its feria and its motorcycle championship.

# Influence celebrities

1. fashion
2. behavior
3. time in social media websites

In my book, celebrities wield a negative influence on the lives of young people. 

Fashion is one of the most obvious ways that celebrities impact young individuals. It is is true that celebrities often serve as style icons through interviews, social media, or reality TV and their lifestyle are copied by millions. However this might be dangerous for you health when your body is totally difference. Furthermore, you can suffer financial problems if you spend more money on clothes than you have.

Beyond fashion, celebrities also impact the behavior of young people. Unfortunately, this influence is not always positive. They normalize harmful actions such as substance abuse or extreme dieting

Last but not least, the smartphone usage as a professional tool also has a potential impact on mental health for younger generation, who spend hours in front of a reduced screen

To sum up, I believe the celebrities influence for young people has more cons than advantages due to all these topics and more.

# Ban on smoking everywhere

1. healthy
2. economy
3. environments without cigars/cigarretes

In my book, there should be a total ban on smoking everywhere, but specially in all public spaces.

One of the strongest arguments in favor is the fact that a smoking ban would significantly improve public health. Needless to say, by banning smoking everywhere, non-smokers could avoid the health risks associated with passive smoking.

Beyond health, the costs associated with treating smoking illnesses are substantial. A reduction in smoking rates could alleviate some of these economic pressures, allowing healthcare resources to be redirected toward other public health issues.

Last but not least, the environmental implications must not be overlooked. May you imagine streets, gardens and beaches without cigarette butts?

To sum up, I believe that prohibiting smoking in public places would bring about positive changes, creating a more enjoyable environment for all.

# Cars should be banned from cities centres (noise and pollution, transport)

1. pollution
2. traffic
3. transport alternatives

In cities everywhere, there is growing concern about the effect of motor vehicles on the inhabitants' quality of life. Some people want to prohibit cars from urban areas, and to a great extent I agree.

First of all, these vehicles poison the air with their exhaust fumes, contributing to the clouds of smog that hang over many cities, especially in sunny weather. In addition, the sounds of engines and car horns destroys the peace of our neighbourhoods, even at night.

Secondly, the huge amount of traffic nowadays makes cities less pleasant places to live. For instance, crossing busy roads often takes ages. Moreover, they can be dangerous, especially for children, and for the elderly or disabled, too.

Finally, there are often alternatives to travelling by car, such as **the tube**, buses or trams. **Besides,** if there were no cars, far more people would cycle to work, or they could walk there in the fresh air.

In conclusion, urban areas without cars would be much better places to live. Therefore, as long as other means of transport are available, I believe our cities should become totally car-free.

# learn a foreing language

1. society language
2. necessity
3. opt for a new job oportunity

In my book, there are more reasons to learn a foreign language than to pass a test

Everything around us revolves around languages, it is the most important thing in our lives. Society would just not function without it. It is our future and I would personaly love to learn as many as I possibly can.

Not everything in life is done because it is necessary. Learning a new language can be a lot of fun. Many people only do it as a hoby, or their knowledge is something that brings them pride and pleasure.

Secondly, we have people who do it simply to challenge themselves. Truly I believe that having a great outcome that stems from your hard work and dedication to learn something new is a wonderful way to prove your ability to yourself and others. Then there is travelling. It is very important to be able to understand and have a conversation with someone abroad, unless you would like to get lost or worse.

To conclude, I think that learning a new language is an amazing thing no matter why you do it. It is always better to do things out of enjoyment, but even if you do it for a test, that knowledge will always be useful. 

# Every country in the world has problems with pollution and damage to the environment

1. industry
2. transport
3. agriculture

Environmental damage and pollution are currently worldwide problems. In my book, I do not believe will ever be eliminated for three main reasons.

Firstly, industry contributes substantially to every kind of water or air pollution. Power stations, chemical plants and factories pump contaminated waste water out and emit gasses into the air. For example, chemical plants that make plastics or fuel may supply human needs, but destroy the local environment.

Secondly, the fuel from these plants and the products from the factories contribute to the transport which keeps the economy going. Trucks, busses and cars carry goods and people to their destinations. Every day, for example, millions of commuters travel to work.

Finally, due to the vehicles and the other polluting aspects of the economy, waste water is released into the rivers, not only from industry, but also from agriculture. That water is drinking water in some countries not only for humans, but also for animals. Fish and sea life are the final victims as the oceans become full of waste.

As a result of these three main points, I firmly believe that irreversible damage will be done to our planet.

# study in a foreign school

1. different culture and language
2. independent
3. laws in different countries

In my book, every young person should spend a year studying abroad if the opportunity arises. I completely agree with this for three main reasons.

Firstly, apart from learning their usual subjects, these students would also learn other about the culture and language in that country. The different traditions of the host nation as well as being forced to use its language every day would soon give them a deeper understanding of that country as well as their own. For example, ordering and eating the local food, asking directions and even going shopping would all be learning experiences.

Secondly, these young people would become more independent. Being away from their parents would make them have to do their own chores and eat responsibly so they did not become ill. In addition, they would need to organise their own timekeeping and transportation to and from classes.

Finally, these youngsters would have to learn about the laws in their host country. Breaking the law in the other country would lead to problems for themselves, their families and their schools or colleges. Not paying a bus fare could be a serious offence in another country.

In conclusion, I agree that young people should study abroad if possible because they would learn about the culture and language of that country as well as how to live more independently and be law abiding.

# work or money 1

1. time
2. difficulty and effort
3. enjoyable

Nowadays, most people think that it is better to enjoy work than earn a lot of money. Various perspectives on the topic are explored and analyzed in this essay, with the goal of providing a comprehensive understanding of the topic. 

First of all, a very important factor is how much time you spend at work. Everyone wants to have a completed salary and a part-time ocuppation at the same time, which is reasonable. Sometimes it is difficult to find a job with these two characteristics and people have to choose between both

Secondly, before applying for a job you have to value the type of work which is done. Not only if it's about a topic that you enjoy, but you also have to be accurate with the conditions of you contract, the money you earn per hour and the rules that it could have

Last but not least, an essential fact to take into account is if you really enjoy your job. It's horrible work in something which you don't feel well and it can generate mental problems. These problems are recongnized by experts as the most typical causes of depression.

In short, if you want to have a god job you have to take everything into account but in my book, if I were you I would rather enjoy my job than carry forward a terrible employment which gives me a lot of money

# work or money 2

1. stress
2. success
3. satisfaction

Salary is a relevant topic when talking to an employee. But is it really critical? Or is it better to have an employment that you like?

First and foremost, people with high salaries and busy jobs are stressed and do not have time to enjoy their families. The most important moments of their children's development are left in the hands of nannies.

On the other hand, everyone has to be involved is some type of work whether it is for self or for someone else. The work we choose to do determines our lives and measures our level of success in life

Last but not least, feelings of satisfaction from what you have done bring many benefits. The most notable thing is that satisfaction helps employees stay in a good mood while working

In short, earning money gives you the feeling of being a good provider and is related to the evolution you want in your career. Despite this, you may lose quality time with your family or even yourself. I truly believe that it is better to love your job than the money you make, but it can be an advantage if you have both.

# keep animals in zoos 1

1. learn nature
2. prison for animals

Keeping animals in zoos is a controversial issue today because there are many people concerned about animals right. In this essay, I intent to examine the arguments for and against keeping animals in zoos.

One of the strongest arguments in favour is the fact that children can see animals from other countries. Consequently, visiting zoos can help them learn about nature. Furthermore, zoos can help protect some kind of animals, which might be in danger of extinction.

On the other hand, there are several arguments against it. To begin with, it is known that animals in zoos suffer from loneliness since they are not living in their natural enviroment. Secondly, they do not behave as they would do if they were free, because they have to get used to a new way of living, even if they have been born in the zoo. Lastly, people can use them to carry out experiments.

On balance, I'm not in favour of keeping animals in captivity because, as I have shown, that is like prison, which is very sad and detrimental to their well-being.

# keep animals in zoos 2

1. animals care
2. extinction
3. education

In my book, keeping animals in zoos is not as cruel as it is often portrayed. In fact, it can be beneficial for three main reasons.

First of all, they take care of the animals, providing them with nutritious food. Additionally, the animals are cleaned every day and live in good conditions. There is a large number of scientists who work hard to ensure that the animals remain healthy and free from disease.

Secondly, there are some animal species are facing extinction because they have been hunted without any control. At the zoo they are away from these hunters, so they are safe and it is possible to prevent them disappearing.

Finally, there is also an educational reason. Children can see different animals from all over the world alive and from my point of view this is the best way to learn. They also learn to take care of them and the most important thing, to develop a love for them.

In conclusion, I believe keeping animals in a zoo is not more cruel than having them at home, as long as the animals receive proper care and attention.

# we are not doing enough to protect our world

1. waste
2. green life
3. what else to do

Nowadays, everybody is talking about the need to save the planet. Despite this, the problems are getting worse all the time, so maybe we should do more than just talk about them if we really want to make a difference

Firstly, we use more energy and generate more waste than ever before. For example, we drive to the supermarket to buy imported goods wrapped in pastic, and fly halfway round the world for our holidays. In addition, global warming is destroying rainforests, rivers and icecaps while we, in contrast, keep cold by using air conditioning. 

On the other hand, we are now trying to lead a greener way of life. For example, we produce much of our energy from wind and solar power, we can take fast trains instead of planes, and people now recycle trash and unwanted household items.

Nevertheless, these measures alone are insufficient. I beleive we should change our lifestyle completely, for instance by becoming vegetarian, buying far fewer manufactured products and travelling much less. And unless the richest nations give up making constant economic growth their objectives, our planet will face disaster in the long term

# sportspeople are paid to much

1. essential job comparison
2. short career
3. entertaiment is well paid

The topic of athletes' income causes a great deal of discussion, especially in the media. Many people have strong feelings on the subject, and so do I.

First of all, it is true that playing sports for a living is not essential for society. Nurses perform an essential job but they earn very little compared to many sportspeople. Also, a footbal player, for example, will only be playing for a few hours a day, while a nurse might work at least twelve hours a day.

On the other hand, a sportsperson's career does not last long, so the hight salary is only for a limited period of time. Furthermore, an injury can cut short a career. Therefore it is reasonable that athletes receive substantial earnings. 

In addition, sports occupies a central place in modern socity, giving pleasure to many people. The fact that it is such a popular form of entertaiment means that high salaries can perhaps be justified.

To sum up, sportspeople are very valuable but the often deserve the money. The real issue is that people in more important jobs are paid too little.

# Which is more important - friends or family?

1. who you can enjoy yourself with
2. who will help you when you have problems
3. borrow clothes

Nowadays, some people argue friends matter more important than family, while others disagree. Various perspectives on the topic are analyzed in this essay.

First, many find buddies much more enjoyable than relatives. However, it depends on size of the family and the ages of siblings. In families with many members, you can never get bored.  

Furthermore, you may have friends who are better persons than your next of kin Despite this, you family will not disappear when you have problems and some help is required. Family is forever, even if you stay mad at them for a long time. A close relationship makes problems forget

In addition, the opportunity to wear different clothes increases exponentially. This could be an issue for youngers if they think these clothes are too ugly. However, when you are older and into fashion, you will be able to borrow the favorite jeans of your sister or an expensive dress for free

In short, having good friendships is vital, but in my book, family holds more importance since you can enjoy them every day, get daily support and multiply your options to be fashionable.

# how good is to eat at fast food restaurants?

1. even though they are also aware that it is unhealthy
2. because the food is tasty and quick
3. cheap

Having lunch at fast-casual eateries is a controversial issue today because there are many people concerned about well-being. I intend to analyze the different perspectives on the topic in this essay.

First and foremost, it is undeniable the success of restaurants such us McDonals or Burger King, full of customers throughout the day. Regardless of the quality of their meat or fries, families frequently visit these franchises, often visiting once a week. Nowadays, many people are overweight but they seem unconcerned about their health.

Moreover, many youngsters are addicted to their tasty dishes and children love the small toy given as present. I have a daughter who adores this kind of meals becuase of the minimal waiting time. As soon as you order, as soon as you start eating, preventing boredom that may occur in other restaurants where preparation time is longer.

Last but not least, the low price is an crucial argument. Menus are budget-friendly. No too much money is spent to get a drink, a burger plus a desert. In contrast, having a healthy diet can be cheap as well, but people show little interest in fruit or vegetables. While it may seem economical in the short term, it can be costly in the long term if you have to pay in the future for your health due to issues related with your diet

In conclusion and having considered all the above, I firmly believe that fast-good is detrimental to health, although sometimes the food is delicious

# Is it important to follow national and international events in the news?

1. major events
2. news about famous people
3. pleasure

Keeping up to date about news around the world is a concern for many people. I intend to analyze the different perspectives on the topic in this essay.

First and foremost, it is undeniable that people can make more informed decisions in their personal and professional lives by knowing what is happening nationally and globally. For instance, you will not travel to Rusia at the moment when you know about the current war against Ukraine. Also, you may organize a alternative plan if you know the weather warnings and it will be raining all weekend

In addition, being aware of famous people such as singers, athletes or politicians, enables individuals to participate more actively in their communities and contribute to discussions on current matters. However, I personally get bored when people talk about gossips

Last but not least, not everything in life is done because it is necessary. Watching the news on television can be just relaxing. I enjoy having breakfast and listening to the radio every morning

In conclusion, it is indeed important to follow national and international events in the news. I believe that doing so it enhances one's knowledge and understanding of the world, although you dislike its content
