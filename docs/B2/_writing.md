Hi Maria,
Great to hear from you! Yeah, that sound amazing! I've don canoeing before, so I reckon we'll be fine. Camping sounds pretty cool too!
see you soon
Rafa

Hi Tom,
How are things? Do you fancy coming to stay with me for a few days in the summer holidays? My uncle's given me his old canoe, so we could try it out on the lake near our house. Do you think we'll be able tosteer it together? Plus, I've got a new tent, so we could camp out if the weather's good. Should be fun! Let me know
Write soon,
Rafa

Hi Linda,
Thanks very much for your last letter. I'm fine, and I'm glad to hear you're well, too.
I'm sure you'll have a great time here. There are lots of sports you can do in the countryside, such as hill-walking or mountain-biking, as well as water sports like rowing and sailing on the lake. It will be too cold for swimming, though.
If you'd rather go to a sports centre there's a really good one which has facilities for things like squash and basketball, and a olimpic-size pool where they play water-polo. Now that really is good exercise: I tried it once and I was exhausted after about ten minutes!
Actually, it'd be nice if you could both do the same sports so that we have more time together. I sometimes go ice skating - would you like to try that? Or how about playing tennis? If so, I'll need to book ahead to make sure we get a court.
Anyway, let me know what you'd like to do and I'll make some arrangements.
Bye for now.
Sam
