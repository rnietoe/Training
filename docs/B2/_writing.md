### Popular tourist destination

In my book, living in a tourist destination is better for three main reasons.

First of all, it is true that living in a tourist place increases the local economy. Foreigners are used to spending their money there creating jobs for locals.

Therefore it is reasonable that the quality of life in tourist cities is better when you have money and a wide range of services to enjoy.

It is a fact of common knowledge that these destianations are well connected by transport, so living here allows you to travel abroad easily since you do not need to travel to a near city just to catch a plane or a train (maybe a ship as well).

To sum up, there are many adventages on living in a place where tourist like to travel. I also want to add that i am lucky to live in Jerez de la Frontera, world famous for its wines, its feria and its motorcycle championship.

### Influence celebrities

In my book, celebrities wield a negative influence on the lives of young people. 

Fashion is one of the most obvious ways that celebrities impact young individuals. It is is true that celebrities often serve as style icons through interviews, social media, or reality TV and their lifestyle are copied by millions. However this might be dangerous for you health when your body is totally difference. Furthermore, you can suffer financial problems if you spend more money on clothes than you have.

Beyond fashion, celebrities also impact the behavior of young people. Unfortunately, this influence is not always positive. They normalize harmful actions such as substance abuse or extreme dieting

Last but not least, the smartphone usage as a professional tool also has a potential impact on mental health for younger generation, who spend hours in front of a reduced screen

To sum up, I believe the celebrities influence for young people has more cons than advantages due to all these topics and more.

### Ban on smoking everywhere

In my book, there should be a total ban on smoking everywhere, but specially in all public spaces.

One of the strongest arguments in favor is the fact that a smoking ban would significantly improve public health. Needless to say, by banning smoking everywhere, non-smokers could avoid the health risks associated with passive smoking.

Beyond health, the costs associated with treating smoking illnesses are substantial. A reduction in smoking rates could alleviate some of these economic pressures, allowing healthcare resources to be redirected toward other public health issues.

Last but not least, the environmental implications must not be overlooked. May you imagine streets, gardens and beaches without cigarette butts?

To sum up, I believe that prohibiting smoking in public places would bring about positive changes, creating a more enjoyable environment for all.
