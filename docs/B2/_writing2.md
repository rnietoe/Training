# review - Drama Club Performance of The Sound of Music.

Have you ever sang in a musical? It would be difficult to improve on the performance of the drama club singers in their performance of The Sound of Music last Saturday night. It was exciting, dramatic and romantic all in the same play.

This classic musical was performed in the school hall and watched by interested pupils, proud parents and nervous teachers. The main roles were taken by the club members who could act and sing very well, with a chorus of other singers to support them.

Although Emma Jones and John Stevens both gave exceptional performances as Maria and Captain Von Trapp, for me Lee Murray stole the show as the youngest child every time he was on stage. The set and the costumes were all made as projects for other clubs and classes and in my opinion looked so good, you could imagine you were in the Alps.

Although I couldn’t have been more proud of the cast, I don’t believe there is anything to gain by taking the show to other schools as some have suggested. It would interfere too much n their studies and I’m sure most schools are usually interested in seeing their own friends, children and students perform. However, I am truly looking forward to next year’s performance, whatever it is. Have you any suggestions?

# review - Can you recommend a local restaurant, café or snack bar?

The Green Cat

Going out with your family for a meal is always a great idea, however, in practice it can lead to arguments. Why not try The Green Cat, which is a great little cafe/restaurant overlooking the lake behind the city?

The Fare
The menu is split into sections especially for youngsters, teenagers, and adults. Pizza, chips, sushi, chicken nuggets and more for the kids, larger helpings and more complexity for teenagers and wonderfully prepared traditional dishes for the older ones.

The setting
As soon as you walk in the door, you start to unwind. There is quiet, relaxing background music and the tables are spaced quite far apart. The seats are also really comfortable, which made my dad in particular really happy.

Tech
Use the QR code on the table to order. Each table also has recharging USB sockets, and the restaurant has superfast WIFI. What more could you want from a restaurant.

Recommendations
I would thoroughly recommend the Green Cat to anyone who wants to take their family out for a meal. It’s simple, relaxing and has great but simple food.

# Stories wanted

When Susie’s family arrived at the hotel, they were surprised to see hundreds of photographers
waiting outside. They had no idea what was going on. Everyone acted like crazy. It wasn’t a famous
hotel. The only thing less famous than the hotel itself are the clients of this hotel. So why would any
photographer and or journalist be interested in this place?
Because they already had a reservation, they entered the hotel. Everything seemed normal, until they
went on a dinner. They hadn’t had a proper meal the whole day, so a restaurant in the hotel was what
they were had been looking forward to.
After they recieved their meal, their happiness disappeared. It was disgusting, the steaks they
ordered were dry like a shoe. Before they managed to chew those steaks, the a celebrity showed up.
It was Gordon Ramsay, a famous chef. He was had been shooting his series “Hotel Hell” here. He asked
everyone to leave. Unusual request, but not from him. That was it, he closed the kitchen. Everyone
knew what that meant … and regreted every bite.

# cinema reviews wanted

To whom it may concern:

I recently watched the film Super Mario Bros with my children which we loved, so I'd like to tell other reader why we utterly amused ourselves with some specific details of this box office smash.

One of the strongest arguments in favor is the fact that everyone who has played Nintendo consoles will like this movie. They will remember when they played at home being twenty five years younger.

But the most suitable characteristic might be the full story, WHICH WAS one hundred percent like the video games. All the characters were there: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Kong...

Last but not least was the soundtrack. The film plays the same nineties music from the video games. IT REALLY TOOK ME BACK.

Taking all these aspects into account, I recommend GIVING SUPER MARIO BROS A SHOT. In my opinion it's the best choice to spend an enjoyable time with your family.

I would be delighted to read this review next month in your magazine and share it with friends who also have a soft spot for your articles.

Your faithfully.

# concert reviews wanted

To whom it may concern:

I'm writing in response to your advertisiment posted in the magazine about concert reviews.

I was recently at the Queen Tribute which I loved, so I'd like to tell other readers why I utterly enjoyED some specific details of the concert.

One of the strongest arguments in favor is the fact that the singer's voice was really similar to that of Freddie Mercury. IT WAS ALMOST SURREAL AND FELT LIKE THE REAL DEAL

But the most suitable characteristic might be the location where the concert took place. It was IN an awesome castle BUILT centuries ago in Cadiz.

Last but not least was the price for drinks and merchandising. I used to pay 10 euros per beer at concerts but there it was only 6. I bought a t'shirt with the money I SAVED on drinks.

Taking all these aspects into account, I recommend paying attention when tickets for new concerts released. In my opinion it's the best choice for its QUALITY TO PRICE ratio.

I would be delighted to read this review next month in your magazine and share it with friends who also have a soft spot for your articles.

Your faithfully.
Rafa

# smartphone reviews wanted

The best phone ever

I'm writing in response to your advertisement posted in the magazine.

I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 which I love, so I'd like to tell you why I utterly appreciate some specific features of my new smartphone.

One of the strongest arguments in favor is the fact that it's very light so its weight is an important advantage for me when I put it in my TROUSER pocket.

But the most suitable feature might be that it is made by Google and it has free updates for three years.

Last but not least is its price. This model is under 500 euros while Apple devices cost twice as much.

Taking all these aspects into account, I recommend the latest version of Google Pixel IF you need to buy a new phone. In my opinion it's the best choice for its QUALITY TO PRICE ratio.

I would be delighted to read this review next month in your magazine

Your faithfully.
Rafa

# report - a one-day excursion with your class to a local place of interest.

Trip to The Palace of Holyrood House
This report is about the trip our class took to the royal family’s residence in Edinburgh, the Palace of Holyrood House. We went there last Friday morning, returning in the early afternoon to miss the Friday rush hour traffic.

Holyrood House
There was much interesting history that happened in the palace, including a murder and other intrigue. The furnishings were often of historic value also, but the main point which everyone loved was not the secret staircase, but the gorgeous views of the cliffs of Salsbury Crags outside in the park.

Holyrood Park
The weather was good, and everyone had been told to come with enough food for their lunch. Everybody went across the road to the park and ate their lunches and fed the ducks in the pond with what they did not need.

Return
For the afternoon a stroll up the Royal Mile had been planned, with souvenir shopping also on the agenda. A good time was had by all, and they voted the trip a success, even if it was a little short.

# report - on English-language film club
​
Introduction
The purspose of this report is to outline the characteristics that the future film club should have. I interviewed 30 students whose main interest is movies in order to obtain this information.

Different genres
According to those interviewed, there should be different film genres every week, so everyone could watch what they like. Furthermore, they thought that the movies ought to be the latest ones being shown as they expect that the club would be active and popular.

Weekly meetings
Funnily enough, most students who I interviewed said that a two-hour meeting should be held on Mondays, to give them enough time to think about the main points to be discussed.

Advertisement
In their opinion the weekly student newspaper would be the best way to advertise the club, because each student receives a copy of the newspaper once a week.

Suggestions
Due to all thees topics I have written in this report I would recommend setting up this new club as an entertaining way of promoting English language learning. Although there might be some disagreements about the genre of the films, a monthly survey could be conducted to determinate members' preferences.

# letter of application 1

Dear Mr. Jones,

I am writing in answer to your advertisement in the local newspaper for a holiday club worker.

I am one of the oldest in a large family, so I am used to caring for children, especially those under 10 years old. In fact, I used to work at an after-school club teaching primary school aged children English. I can supply references from there if need be.

I always loved English at school, and although I am not studying for a qualification, such as Cambridge B2 first, I use some of these materials, so I do not lose the English I have, and to try and improve.

I firmly believe that I will be a good fit for this job. I have work experience with young children, am interested in English and will be free during the holiday period. I can provide both character and work references and would be pleased to attend an interview, either online or face to face.

I look forward to hearing from you and hope I will be successful in my application.

Yours sincerely

Alan Teacher

# Letter of application 2

Dear Mrs Hopkins:

I am writing this card because I would like to apply to be the person who joins a small group for a trip around the world.

I am particulary interested in this position. Since I was little I dreamed of exploring the world. I was 8 years old the first time that I read a book about it, about an eighteen-day trip, and after that I became a fanatic on this topic.

In addition, as you can see in my CV, I have a C1 certification in English, a B2 certification in French and Spanish and I can also speak in German, my native language. Furthermore, you have to know that these certificates have been awarded by a prestigious academy.

Finally, I have to confess that I have neved travelled to the countryside so my experience is very limited, but for that I think this is my best chance.

Your consideration of my application is greatly appreciated. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value in a future interview. Lastly, I can be contacted by phone on 123 456 789.

Yours sincerily,
Rafa

# mail - formal

Dear Ms Salomon,

My name is Alan Grumbleson, and I am writing in reply to your advertisement for part-time team leaders for an activity camp for children from overseas. Let me give you some more information.

I am the oldest of four children so I have had a lot of experience looking after younger children and their friends and have organised events such as treasure hunts, hikes and cycling trips, as well as the usual division of chores.

As for communication, I have been in my school debating team for the last year, while I also visited France last year as art of an exchange programme, so my French is better than average.

My favourite sport is football, but I am more enthusiastic than good, but am a reliable hiker and reasonable rock climber.

All in all, I believe I am a good fit for this position and would be keen to attend an interview if necessary.

Yours sincerely

Alan Grumbleson

# mail - semi-formal

Dear sir / madam,

My name is Alan Grumbleson and I am writing in answer to your advert in the local paper for help organising a series of music festivals.

Let me tell you a bit about myself. I am tall, strong and fit and would be able to help with any lifting that needed to be done. I also excel at physics at school, so I know my way around a wiring diagram as long as they’re not too complicated.

I was recently on the committee for organising our high school concert, which had over 15 performances, all with lights and sound. Collaborating with others made everything fit together well and it turned out to be something I really enjoyed.

As far as time goes, out of the two month holiday, I could offer you three weeks, if you want. I have other plans and am going abroad for most of the remainder of the vacation. So I would be free from the 1st of July to the 22nd of July.

I would really appreciate the chance to be able to help because this would fit in with the course I am going to do at college next year.

Yours sincerely

Alan Grumbleson.

# mail - informal

Hi,

Great to hear from you, although it seems you are in a bit of a quandary about what to do. Let’s see if I can help.

I think the main thing you mentioned is that your parents are 50 next month. That’s great and everything, but it doesn’t leave much time for you to do anything. You were talking about a party, but if you only have a month, you’d probably have it at home.

The same applies to taking them away for the weekend. If it was to be special, then anywhere that is any good would probably be booked by now. The other thing is, what would you do at the hotel?

The best thing you could do is to take them out for a meal somewhere and invite all their close friends, saying they’ll need to pay for themselves as their present. I’m sure you could find a restaurant that would be able to do that.

Let me know what you end up doing. I’ll be in that situation in a few years, so it’ll be good to have a few ideas.

Later

Alan

# mail - Flatmate

Dear Jody,

Thanks for your letter; it was good to hear from you. You'll be pleased to know that I've found someone to share the flat with. She's called Elena and she's an actress from Canada. I interviewed about 20 people before I saw her. She's very nice and **we really get on well together**. Let me tell you a little about her. She's about 1m 50cm in height and has short, black, curly hair; in fact she looks a bit like your sister! She's incredibly lively so **she should be fun to have around**. We're both interested in the same type of films and we seem to have similar tastes in music. She hates cooking so I won't have to worry about having a messy kitchen!

**One drawback is that,** when she is making a movie, she needs to get up really early , about 4.30 in the morning, to go to the set tot get her make-up and cosume sorted out. She says she'll be really quiet, so we'll have to see. **Anyway,** I haven't noticed any bad habits yet! You must meet her - why don't you come over to the flat next Saturday and we can have a meal together? **Drop me a line to let me know.**

Love,
Tania

Hi Jo,

It is good to receive news from you! I bet you are swimming like a fish. Do you remember when we
were kids and we made a few races in Angelina’s pool?

I understand why you are trying to persuade them but remember that they want your best. If I
were you firstly I would try to talk with your swimming coach and ask him about the possibilities of
training another day. Then if the answer would have been negative I will probably try to do the same
with yours future math teacher. I am sure that everyone knows the importance of practising sports
while studying. So they will find a solution.

If everything doesn’t happen as you and I expect ensure that your parents don’t get mad
with your decision. They are giving their best! Put your education in front first place. Opportunities
to swim you will have a lot during your life. Moreover, you can come to Barcelone and try to catch me
in the pool.
Good luck,
Sam

# article - a great way to spend your free time!

Baking for fun!

I have tried doing several things in my free time, but nothing has caught my imagination as much as this one: Baking. I have always really loved bread, cakes and biscuits so I decided to try making some myself.

I started by helping my mum doing her baking a few times. I think it’s important to see how someone does something in real life, so you can get a feel for the activity. Videos are great and everything, **but nothing beats a teacher.**

Making a cake for dessert if someone is coming round for dinner, or making a big batch of my favourite biscuits to eat with my coffee each day is bliss for me. I become totally engrossed in the activity and then, when the mixture has been divided up and put in the oven, I love to sit and read the newspaper and enjoy the wonderful aroma.

**Bottom line**, I can’t recommend it enough as long as you have enough equipment and are patient enough to wait for the cakes to bake. Go on, give it a chance!

Jerez Championship 2024!

First and foremost, it is undeniable that a world-famous event like the motorbikes championship increases the local economy. For example, locals sell a vast amount of merchandising, every hotel and touristic apartments are booked in the city center and nearby villages, while visitors spend their money generously at pubs and restaurants . As a result, many jobs opportunities are created 


1. local economy
2. enjoyable entertaiment spending a great weekend
3. pollution

In my book . I belive the following are the main three reasons:



Beyond economy, other strong argument is motorcycles' lover

Last but no least, 

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the motorbikes grand prix in Jerez has more pros than disadvantages due to all these topics and more
