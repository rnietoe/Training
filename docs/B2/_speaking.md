[Cambridge B2 First Speaking: 17 of the Best Ways to Improve](https://www.pronhelp.com/cambridge-b2-first-speaking-17-of-the-best-ways-to-improve/)

Part 1: https://www.pronhelp.com/b2-first-speaking-part-1-questions/

* Do you like to travel? I do, yes. I love travelling because I’m really curious about the world and I think going out and seeing new places is the only way for me to satisfy this curiosity.
* How long have you lived in your home? I’ve lived in my current home for about the last three years. I moved to this place from London, the capital, when I was in my late twenties because I was getting tired of city life.
* Who did the cooking in your family when you were a child? My mum did the cooking when I was a child. I’ve never really thought about why, but I guess at the time it was just traditional gender roles for mums to cook and dads to work, rather than the other way around.
* How popular are bicycles in your town? Bicycles are fairly popular where I live, but cars are still more common by far. I think bikes are gaining more popularity though, and I’ve certainly noticed that many more bicycle lanes have been built recently.
* What are you studying at the moment? I’m studying English Language and Literature at the moment, over at King’s College in London. I started my studies two and a half years ago.
* Personally, I prefer to spend my free time on my own. For example, last week I was given the night off work, and I chose to spend the time unwinding with a book instead of meeting with friends.
* Do you prefer hot or cold weather? I like hot weather much more actually. I’m one of these people who feel really relaxed if it’s really hot and sunny, not like my mum. She much prefers it when it’s cold and wet for some reason.
* Are clothes important to you? Yes, they are. I absolutely love wearing the latest fashions when I have the chance. I have been into fashion for as long as I can remember.


* To be honest, I don’t know much about this, but ... To be completely honest, I know nothing about this, and ...
* As far as I know... From what I understand... As far as I can remember... As far as I’m concerned... If you ask me,
* I think I saw something about this on TV... I think I read a story about this in some newspaper or another
* I believe this has something to do with culture or personality
* ...or something like that

* As far as I know, most people want to buy the cheapest products if they are having money problems.
* From what my married friends tell me, many children like playing computer games, but others find them boring.
* From what I understand, it’s quite common for businessmen not to be able to spend enough time with their families if their company is not doing well.
* To be honest, I don’t know much about this, but I think Christmas is a happy time for most people who have a young family, but it can be incredibly stressful for dysfunctional families.
* I think I saw something about this on TV, in a documentary or something like that, that said girls aren’t very good at science, but some are.
* I read somewhere that traditionally many think boys can’t cook, but I believe that is changing.

* Where do you live?
* Where are you from? I was born in Berlin, but due to family issues I ended up here when I was ten and have been here ever since. 
* Who do you live with?
* How did you get here today?
* How long have you been studying English?
* What do you enjoy most about learning English?
* Do you enjoy long journeys?
* What kind of music do you like? (Why do you enjoy it?)
* What do you have for breakfast?
* Who is your favourite sports personality? (Why?)
* how often... ? | de vez en cuando
    * I go to the cinema **once in a while**.
    * She drinks wine **every now and again**.
    * **From time to time** I visit my mother.
    * I go to the cinema twice a week.
    * She takes these tablets three times a day.
    * I change the sheets **once a fortnight** (fortnight = two weeks).
    * I meet him several times a year.
    * I visit my parents once a month.
    * every morning
    * every day
    * every Tuesday
    * every week
    * every month
    * I take a dance class on **Wednesdays**.
    * I relax on **Saturdays**.




* I think there are various reasons for people learning English, but I think one of the main ones these days for many students is so that they can study abroad
* It’s difficult to say what reasons people have for doing, for learning English, but I imagine that some people continue to learn English because

1. Giving a reason
2. Adding information
3. Comparing to the past

Do you …..?	Yes I do / No I don’t
Have you ……?	Yes I have / No I haven’t
Would you ….?	Yes I would / No I wouldn’t
How important is …?	It’s incredibly important / it’s crucial / it’s essential / it’s important to some extent / it isn’t really important at all / it’s completely unimportant

Part 2 - 1 minute to compare and contrast the two pictures as well as answer the question.

Who they are
What they are doing
When the picture was taken
Where the picture was taken
Why the people are there.

* Even though the women and the group are in different kinds of places, they will probably find it equally as satisfying.
* I think The four people in the second picture need to feel free to express themselves in the same way as the two women do.
* As with the two women, the four people in the second picture need to feel free to express themselves.
* Whereas the girl in the park looks as if she’s just relaxing and taking it easy

*  The people in the second picture are working as a group, however, the two women are working as a pair!!
*  The two women are in what looks like a library, whereas the group seem to be working in a meeting room!!
* Only three people in the second picture seem to be concentrating on what they are doing, but on the contrary, the two women look as if they are completely absorbed.
* Unlike the group, the two women are in what looks like a library.

* weather:
    * It’s obviously hot, because most of the spectators are wearing hats and sunglasses.
    * The weather must be quite warm going by the clothes she is wearing.
* feelings: 
    * 
    * Although he is having a break, his body language shows he is having a really hard time.

Part 3

* In my opinion, using the internet is by far the most important factor here. Do you agree?
* Not at all. In fact, I feel very strongly that doing more exercise is essential in the modern world. What do you say to that?
* Great! I also think working less is crucial, but not nearly as important as exercising!!


!!!!
* I’m absolutely convinced that xxxx is by far the best option because …….
In my opinion, …… is the best due to the fact that …….
As far as I can see, the only choice would be ….. because …….
If you ask me, it’s between ….. and ….. and personally, I would choose ….. for the reason that …..
* Although I thought …… when I saw the question, I see your point and now agree with you on that
*  Sure! And as for meeting friends and being outside. As far as I’m concerned, they are also not as important.

Part 4 

Most young people can play at least one sport.
The majority of elderly people enjoy board games.
A large percentage of the population smokes too much.
Nearly all university students get far too much homework.
A vast amount of business people don’t get enough free time.
A tremendous amount of young girls care too much about fashion.

## WHAT WOULD PEOPLE ENJOY ABOUT GOING ON HOLIDAY IN THESE DIFFERENT WAYS?

**In the first photo we can see** an aircraft in the sky, **while in the second image we see** a train in the mountain.

**The most obvious similarity between the two images is** that they are both transports.

**The main differences may be** speed and views.

Planes are faster and allow people to reach their destinations much quicker than trains. You spend less time in transit, which means more time at your destination

Also from a airplane you can enjoy a view of the landscape below. You can see cities, mountains and even oceans from above the clouds. It gives you a unique perspective that you can't get from the ground.

**In my opinion, I would sooner** travel by train than airplanes due to my fear of flying or stomach upset because of the turbulences.

## WHAT COULD BE DIFFICULT ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS?

**In the first photo we can see** people at the airport waiting for their flights, **while in the second image we see** a road full of cars and a driver stressed by traffic.

**The most obvious similarity between the two images is** the people waiting.

**The main differences may be** where and what they are waiting for.

**In my opinion, I would sooner** be waiting for my flight than being in the car. At the airport you can move around and go to the bathroom if necessary.

Also, if you are the driver of the car, you must focus on the road. This can be very exhausting due to the required concentration, lack of patience because of traffic and **perhaps** some annoying noises from outside such as other car horns.

## COMPARING TV PROGRAMMES

While both images show people watching television, in the first photo we can see a family watching a documentary about animals, whereas the second image shows a couple of girls watching a cooking show.

The family seems to be interested in wildlife and nature. I guess parents are teaching their children about the wonders of the animal kingdom.

On the other hand, girls are **probably** learning delicious recipes cooked by a creative chef. The ladies **seem to** have a lot of fun thanks to their smiles.

**I think the advantages of** watching this type of program **are quite obvious**: you are at home, sitting on your comfortable sofa, in good company, sharing unique moments with your friends or family. In my opinion, at least once a month is usually the best plan.

## COMPARING ROOMS

Although both images show different rooms, in the first photo we can see what could be a doctor's reception, while in the second image we can see a messy bedroom. I bet the this last belongs to a teenager.

The reception or lounge can be used to wait during a medical appointment. Everything seems well organized in a calm environment. The chairs and table are strategically placed for patients to wait.

On the other hand, the bedroom really looks like a chaotic scene with clothes everywhere. Furniture like the bed and nightstand are barely visible.

--

it depends, I think that tidy individuals might be more successful in life because a well-organized environment may contribute to reduce stress and save time when finding things more easily... However, being excessively tidy may lead to perfectionism, and this can result unproductive 

## WHY WOULD SOMEONE GO SHOPPING HERE

Although both images show different type of shopping, in the first photo we can see what could be a local market where fruits and vegetables are sold, whereas in the second image we can see a woman in a store where clothes are well organized. I bet this last shop belongs to a franchise like Zara or Mango.

At the fruit store the owner seems to be advicing the woman on the best products to buy. They are smiling so I guess they are confortable selling and buying products like tomatoes or garlic. In fact we can see the ceiling is full of garlic

On the other hand, the girl does not seem to need help choosing the sweater she is looking for. She looks far more serious than the women in the first image. Maybe she is just taking a look and she won't buy any clothes at the end

--

I'm not sure because I dont like shopping. However, I think many people, mostly women, enjoy shopping because they really care about their appearance. They love getting the latest fashionable dresses. This is something that make them to feel good. Also there are a lot of merchandising, sales... you can't help but hear about them | no puedes evitar oír hablar de ellas.

## How do the students feel about learning in these different ways?

**In the first photo we can see** students at their classroom very bored due to their facial expressions, **while in the second image we see** four student very insterested in their robotics class.

**The main similarity between the two images may be** the children are at school

**The most obvious difference is** how they feel about learning

Everyone in the first photo has not interest in the lesson. **Perhaps** their mind is somewhere else, whereas students at the robotic class are enjoying what they do. Maybe the problem is not only the subject. The teacher can have an important impact on their feeling.

I like math, so I guess the first picture is a history or literature class. **In my opinion, I would sooner** enjoy a scientific class like mathematics, physics or robotics than an education on philosofy, language or history

that was predictable

lastly, | por ultimo,
